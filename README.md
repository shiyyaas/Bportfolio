## 🚀 About Me

I am a passionate BCA (Honors) student driven by curiosity, creativity, and a love for learning. I enjoy turning ideas into real-world projects, whether it's building web apps, organizing tech events, or helping others learn to code.

My journey blends tech skills with hands-on experiences in leadership, teamwork, and self-growth. I'm especially interested in web development, programming logic, and improving my communication skills. This portfolio reflects my growth—one challenge at a time.
