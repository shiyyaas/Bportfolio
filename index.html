        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p class="">
           A passionate BCA (Honors) student driven by curiosity, creativity, and a love for learning. I enjoy turning ideas into real-world projects, whether it's building web apps, organizing tech events, or helping others learn to code. My journey blends tech skills with hands-on experiences in leadership, teamwork, and self-growth. I'm especially interested in web development, programming logic, and improving my communication skills. This portfolio is a reflection of who I am, what I’ve built, and how I’m growing — one challenge at a time.

        <h1>Projects</h1>
        <p>
            I am passionate about learning and have created several projects that showcase my skills and interests. My portfolio includes "P-recipe," a website designed to display a variety of recipes in an engaging and user-friendly format. I also developed "Byte Begin Website," an official site for my college’s tech association, where I contributed to both the design and functionality. Additionally, my personal portfolio website serves as a central place to share more about myself, my work, and my journey in the world of technology. Each project reflects my dedication to creating visually appealing and accessible web experiences.
